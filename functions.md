# Function Reference

There are several in-built functions in VIC&trade; that perform common tasks
which can be abstracted out fairly between various PIC&reg; MCUs.

Implementing these common functions in C or assembly, are often a source of
error for the programmer. Moreover, every programmer might have to reinvent the
wheel by reimplementing these functions in various projects. Hence, we provide
some common functions that are useful to everyone, thus saving time.

The functions are organized in sections by relevance. As newer versions of
VIC&trade; are released in the future, more and more functions will continue to
be added. If there is a function that needs to be deprecated, VIC&trade; will be
very noisy about it and inform the programmer on how to fix their code.
