# Commandline Options

The `vic` compiler can accept commandline options that mainly allow the user to
_reuse_ code for other Microchip's PIC&reg; MCUs and modify the `pragma` statements on the
fly.

Here is a list of the commandline options currently supported in both short and
long form:

- `-h`, `--help`:
    This option displays the help message for the compiler.

- `-V`, `--version`:
    This option displays the version number of the compiler.

- `-d`, `--debug`:
    This option turns on internal debugging of the compiler's parser. The user
should not have to use this option unless filing a bug report. It is mainly for
the developers.

- `-i`, `--intermediate`:
    This option embeds the intermediate code generated by the compiler into the
assembly outputs as comments. This can be used by the user to view how the
compiler generates code for the VIC&trade; statements and by the developer for
debugging code generation.

- `-o <FILE>`, `--output <FILE>`:
    This option tells the compiler to save the assembly output to the `FILE`
argument provided. If the user does not provide this option the compiler
prints the assembly output to the screen(`stdout`).

- `-p <MCU Target>`, `--pic <MCU Target>`:
    This is the most **useful** of all options where the user can compile a code
written for one type of Microchip's PIC&reg; MCU target for a different MCU target. This
enables the user to achieve the following goals:

    1. allow for code reuse between MCUs, allowing compilation to various targets
    1. verify if a piece of code can work on another Microchip's PIC&reg; MCU without reading that MCU's data sheet
    1. find out the parts of the code which will _not_ work on another MCU

Based on these options here are some sample examples on how to use them:

    $ vic -o helloworld.asm helloworld.vic
    $ vic -p p16f631 -o helloworld.asm helloworld.vic
    $ vic -h
    $ vic -V
    $ vic -i -o helloworld.asm helloworld.vic

Now that we have learned enough about using the `vic` compiler, let us move on
to studying the various available in-built functions for VIC&trade;.
