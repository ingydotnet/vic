# What is VIC&trade; ?

1. What is VIC&trade; ?

    VIC&trade; is a domain specific language to write code for
[Microchip's](http://www.microchip.com) PIC&reg; microcontrollers (MCU).
It's aim is for users or developers to write code that looks
simple, logical and can hide complexities that are in-built into VIC&trade; as language
primitives. The name of the compiler to compile the language is also called
`vic`.

1. Why should you use VIC&trade; ?

    If you :
    
    - like using PIC&reg; MCUs, do not like coding in PIC specific
C and/or assembly, would like to understand what your code does months or years
from now, then you should use VIC&trade;.
    - want to port existing code seamlessly
to other MCUs in the same family without making any changes, you can
use VIC&trade;. 
    - want to automatically simulate your code using supported PIC&reg;
  simulators, you should use VIC&trade;.
    - like scripting languages you will like using VIC&trade;. It is designed in the
  same vein.

1. Why was the decision made to create VIC&trade; ?

    While coding firmware for various MCU projects, we ended up using a
lot of common code between them. So we abstracted them into header files with
macros, but that wasn't enough so we went down the path of auto-generating these
macros and instead went a step further and created a domain specific language --
VIC&trade;. For more details look at its [philosophy](./philosophy.html).

    Our aim was to enable us to write code that looked really simple, was
verifiable using a PIC&reg; simulator like [GNU PIC simulator](http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsim.html) `gpsim`,
and did not need detailed reading of the data
sheets every time we chose a particular MCU. We wanted to read the MCU data
sheet once, abstract it out and then start using it. The work for abstraction is
already done and now anyone can use it without having to read all the pages of a
PIC&reg; MCU's data sheet.

1. Will VIC&trade; support other MCUs like AVR, 8051, ARM-Cortex etc. ?

    Currently, we are focused on supporting PIC&reg; MCUs. There are so many
of them ! If you like using AVR, maybe the popular [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) is a better bet. This
doesn't mean that in the future we will not support the Atmel or Maxim or Freescale MCU products.

1. What license is the VIC&trade; released under ?

    VIC&trade; is dual licensed under the [Perl Artistic license](http://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0) and the [GNU General Public
License](https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt). You can distribute the VIC&trade; compiler by following the requirements of
the afore mentioned licenses.

1. Can I create a proprietary compiler for the VIC&trade; language ?

    Yes you may, but you cannot name it **VIC&trade;** or any derivative of that name.
VIC&trade; is designed to make life easy for its users. Users should *not* have to pay for a compiler. If you
have suggestions and improvements, we appreciate you contributing them for the
betterment of the product and the benefit of the community.

    You are free to make supporting applications like a debugger or a simulator for
it though. We can help make VIC&trade; integrate with such applications.

1. Where can I download VIC&trade; ?

    You can download the **official** development version of VIC&trade; from [Github](https://github.com/vikasnkumar/vic).
    
    You can also download the releases from [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org). For
more details on installation refer to the [installation](./install.html) page.

1. What are the operating systems that VIC&trade; supports ?

    The VIC&trade; compiler works on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Windows.
So far, we have only tested the code generated by VIC&trade; with `gpasm` from
[gputils](http://gputils.sourceforge.net/) and the simulator we have tested with is [gpsim](http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsim.html). You may
want to test with Microchip's PIC&reg; compiler and simulator on Windows and
Linux and let us know how it fares.

    We will be interested in seeing examples where it fails to work as expected.

1. How do I help in development of VIC&trade; ?

    VIC&trade; needs more testing on real chips, more interesting examples and bug
reports. If you are willing to do this, please feel free to fork VIC&trade; and
send us pull requests or submit patches on the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/vikasnkumar/vic/issues).

1. What editor or IDE is needed for VIC&trade; ?

    We use [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) as our editor of choice on all the systems we support,
but you could use any text editor of your choice. We provide a syntax
highlighting file located at `share/vic.vim` for Vim as part of the distribution of VIC&trade;.

1. How does one compile VIC&trade; programs ?

    Please refer to the [getting started documentation](gettingstarted.md) for more details.

1. How does one compile the PIC&reg; assembly code generated by VIC&trade; ?

    You can use `gpasm` from the [gputils](http://gputils.sourceforge.net/) toolkit on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD
and OpenBSD. On Windows, if you have a Windows build of `gputils` you may use
that or you can use [Microchip's compilers](http://www.microchip.com/compilers/) for PIC&reg; assembly.

1. Which simulator is to be used with VIC&trade; ?

    VIC&trade; supports [gpsim](http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsim.html) as its default simulator but future support
for other simulators may be added as time permits.
